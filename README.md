## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### **Prerequisites**
- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- Node.js and npm installed (for JSON Server)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Chrome or any web browser

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/azmi-adan/task_pro
cd taskpro
```

### **Step 2: Install Flutter Dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### **Step 3: Start the JSON Server (Backend)**
Open a **new terminal window** and run:
```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

**Important:**
- This command starts your mock backend API on port 3000
- Keep this terminal running while using the app
- The server will use the `db.json` file in your project root
- You should see output like: `Resources: http://localhost:3000/tasks`

### **Step 4: Run the Flutter Application**
Open **another terminal window** and run:
```bash
flutter run -d web-server
```

**Alternative commands for different platforms:**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome        # Run in Chrome browser
flutter run -d edge          # Run in Edge browser  
flutter run                  # Run on connected device/emulator
```

### **Step 5: Use the Application**
1. The app will open automatically in your browser
2. You'll see the **Splash Screen** first
3. Navigate to **Signup** to create a new account
4. Or click **Login** if you already have an account
5. Start managing your tasks!

  - `POST http://localhost:3000/tasks` - Create new task
  - `PUT http://localhost:3000/tasks/:id` - Update task
  - `DELETE http://localhost:3000/tasks/:id` - Delete task
